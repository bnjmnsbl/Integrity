# URL MINIONATOR

## A microservice that creates long, complex and minionated URLs

It works like an URL shortener, but translates them into minion language (which makes most URLs actually longer, duh!). 

This probably makes not much sense, but there you go. 

You CAN turn this app into a URL shortener easily, by making a few changes to the genShort() function. You'll probably figure that out. 

## Usage

Create a new minionated URL by calling localhost/new/[www.YOURURL.com]


Enjoy!
