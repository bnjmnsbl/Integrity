# URL MINIONATOR

## A microservice that creates long, complex and minionated URLs

It works like an URL shortener, but makes most URLs actually longer. 

This probably makes not much sense, but there you go. 

You CAN turn this app into a URL shortener easily, by making a few changes to the genShort() function. You'll probably figure that out. 

Enjoy!
