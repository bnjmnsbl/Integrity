This is a microservice that creates really long and complex URLs out of regular URLS.

Why?

Well, there were already many URL shorteners around, so this is a URL longener.

This probably makes not much sense, but there you go. 

You CAN turn this app into a URL shortener easily, though, by changing the loop length
in urlCheck's genShort() function. You'll probably figure that out. 

Enjoy!
